WOKWI has a disadvantage when it comes to simulating motion sensor. Because it doesn't do what it's supposed to be done.
Unlike TinkerCAD, which supports this feature which makes it close to reality
After you finish watching my WOKWI project you may refer to the other file "TinkerCAD" to see how it works.
